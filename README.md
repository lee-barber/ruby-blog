Gems Used:

We needed the sinatra gem in order to interact with the sqlite3 database.

We added the sqlite3 gem because the rake tasks deal with an SQL database using the ActiveRecord ORM.

We added the sinatra-activerecord gem because it helps with extending sinatra with activerecord helpers.

We added the rake gem because it has prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles much easier.

We added the pry gem to help with debugging error's.


Team member roles:

Lee Barber created the User's model, sign up option & was the master of the project.

Aaron Brown created the home page.
